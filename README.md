# Instagram-Fake-Profile-Detector-Analysis-with-Voting-Classifier-
This project uses machine learning classifiers to detect fake Instagram profiles. We explore, preprocess, and model the data using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM. Finally, we combine these classifiers with a Voting Classifier for enhanced prediction accuracy.
